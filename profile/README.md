# Fresher's Training

## Introduction to Linux, Scripting and Python

This is the first module required by all trainees to introduce them to basic fundamentals of working on a Linux System, basic scripting skills in Linux and Python programming.

- **LINUX OS** access is the first and foremost thing everyone should get setup with. Although, you have access to **CentOS** Linux in the Lab., it is very easy to setup a Linux distribution on your own laptop or desktop running windows.
  - The preferred and recommneded method for it is **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)**.  [Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL2)](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/eda-wsl2) provides detail instructions on how to enable WSL and then install the Linux distribution **Ubuntu 24.04** on it. Then you can install **iverilog** and **gtkwave** to start doing difital design. **NOTE** Please follow these instructions carefully and don't use other guides on the internet.
  - The other _alternative_ is **Virutal Box** from Oracle. If you already have Virtual Box installed and **Ubunut 24.04** installed, then you can use it as well. Rememeber, this is much more resource hungry than WSL. [This module on Virtual Box](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/eda-virtualmachine) provides instructions on how to install it.
- **LINUX COMMANDS**: For those who are new to Linux or rusty in it, [these set of 8 modules](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi-org/module-cs3-301) introduces the candidate from basic to expert commands in Linux.
- **BASIC LINUX SCRIPTING** is an essential productivity skill for any VLSI engineer. [Intro to Linux Shell Scripting](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-free/) is an excellent free course on Udemy which intorduces basic linux scripting to begineers.
- **PYTHON PROGRAMMING** is another essential productivity tool. [AI Python for Beginners](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-python-for-beginners/) is an excellent short from deepLearning.ai that not only introduces Python programming but it teaches how to use modern AI chatbots to increase your efficiency in programming.
